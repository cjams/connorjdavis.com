What do you think of when you hear the word "hacker"? Probably a person in a black room in a black hoodie
staring at a screen that looks like the matrix with lime green text flowing not horizontally, but _vertically_.

The notion that hacking involves illicit activity with a computer is wrong. Or rather, it is incomplete.
Society has co-opted this term and in doing so has overlayed this negative meaning onto it.

So what does it actually mean?

To answer this, we have to go back to the early 1970s. During this time, the creators and users of the early
Internet at various universities created a file that contained certain terms
related to the systems they were working on. This file became known as the [Jargon File](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/pt01.html).
The Jargon File contains many terms commonly used in hacker subcultures, and some such as "bug" and "troll" have enjoyed
widespread adoption by society today. The Jargon File offers several definitions of hacker:

> hacker: (n) A person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities,
> as opposed to most users, who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary. RFC1392, the Internet Users' Glossary,
> usefully amplifies this as: A person who delights in having an intimate understanding of the internal workings of
> a system, computers and computer networks in particular.
>
>   ...
>
>   An expert or enthusiast of any kind. One might be an astronomy hacker, for example.
>
>   ... 
>
>   One who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations.
>
>   ... 
>
>   [deprecated] A malicious meddler who tries to discover senstive information by poking around. Hence
>   password hacker, network hacker. The correct term for this sense is [cracker](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/C/cracker.html).

This definition does a much better job of capturing the true essence of hacking. It underscores the most essential
traits of hacking: deep understanding, competence, curiosity, and creativity. A hacker is someone who comes to understand
a system so deeply, they can discover novel ways of (ab)using it. They are especially skilled at combining systems in
unexpected ways, beyond the original design of either system, to overcome the boundaries and limitations of either system. 

The only thing I would add is that hacking applies to any complex system, not just computer systems. Extending the
notion of hacking to many domains is where I actually agree with society's use of the term. There are biohackers,
gym hackers, food hackers, work hackers, life hackers, etc. Hacking is a mindset which can be applied to any domain of life
in which there are observable inputs and outputs. You try a bunch of inputs, some of them unexpected, and
observe how the system behaves. You then take your learnings from your experiments and share it with others. This
open sharing of information is another part of the hacker ethos.

Since hacking is a mindset, a way of questioning the world, it can be learned. It is a skill that can be devleoped.
It is a skill that I intend to keep developing in myself and to help others develop it as well.

I have many things I want to explore and learn, such as nerual networks, LLMs, robotics. I have a decent background
in computer security, so I'm interested in exploring the intersection of these things. I'm also a hobbyist mushroom
cultivator, and I'm interested in finding new hacks at the boundary of cultivation, AI, and robotics, like [this one](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/scirobotics.adk8019)

As I learn, I'll be sharing along the way. Posting regular updates on this blog as well as creating video content, in addition
to the code and other things that I build. I'm a complete noob at making compelling video, so it should be a good
learning experience. My goal is to build an audience so that I can connect with like-minded curious people who 
are interested in cultivating the hacker mindset in themselves.
