This is my first post in a while.

Lately I've been developing a [mushroom growing app](https://github.com/mycomize/grow-app). This is an open-source
project that enables citizen science for mushroom growing. For a while now, I have wanted a
tool that allows me to keep track of my grows and to run experiments with various
controllable parameters. I've also wanted to be able to learn from others' techniques
more effectively. There are plenty of forums online for sharing, however it is difficult
to rigourously repeat what others have done, as the sharing tends to happen in unstructured
natural language and often lacks critical details needed for repeatability.

The app has three conceptual sections: Grows, Teks, and IoT Gateways. The Grows
section provides grow management. You can add/remove grows, schedule tasks, view grow
progress and key characterstics health status and cost. The app focuses on bulk grows for
the initial version. Each grow has 5 stages, and the user can add items, environmental conditions, tasks, notes, and IoT Gateway controls to each stage.

Teks are similar to grows, but they are a more "abstract" version, similar to a recipe vs
doing the actual cooking. Teks are portable instructions that can be shared and instantiated
into actual grows.

IoT Gateways are connections to Internet-of-Things (IoT) sensor hubs. For the initial
version, [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is the only one supported.
I chose Home Assistant because it is a widely used free and open-source home automation platform and
is one I'm fairly familiar with. You can connect many different sensors, especially those relevant
to providing optimal mushroom growing conditions (temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, light, etc).
You can also write custom automations, so that you can react to the environment changing. For example,
if the spawn incubator temperature falls too low, it can trigger a heat mat to turn on to bring it
back into optimal range. Home Assistant also supports cameras and embedded controllers such as
ESPHome, and it is extendible so support can be added for just about anything if it doesn't exist already.
I feel there is a ton of untapped potential for experimentation and building cool things with this in
the mushroom cultivation world.

The IoT Gateway connects to the Home Assistant API and receives
real-time updates over WebSockets. All the controls, sensors, and automations are accesible from
within app. They can be linked to specific grow stages for different tasks, like enforcing environmental
conditions (e.g. temperature range), or detecting anomalies in sensor values (e.g. discoloration,
spikes of volatile organic compounds, etc.).

These three sections will be present in the first version of the app, as it is already getting pretty
complex. Later I would like to add "Lab" section that provides first-class support for running
experiments. You should be able to have a grow, and tweak some aspect of it, say a different substrate
material, or a slightly higher temperature range during bulk colonization, or more light. The space of
potential experimental inputs is massive here, so provding a clean "diffing" mechanism that allows the
user to easily compare and contrast the control vs experiemental variables and track how they effect
the outputs like yield is what I'm thinking of.

In the near future I will be publishing posts that dive into some of the technical designs that
I've made for the app as they are applicable to more than just mushroom growing.

Lately I've been thinking about work, my relationship to it, and what it means to do great work.
Work is important to me, and I've learned over the past 2 years or so that doing *great* work
is really important to my wellbeing. I feel like shit when I know inside that I haven't lived up to my potential.
I've read a lot books lately related to work, some of which I've [written](/posts/book-review-the-creative-act)
[about](/posts/book-review-mans-search-for-meaning) and [others I haven't](https://www.amazon.com/Tiny-Experiments-Freely-Goal-Obsessed-World/dp/0593715136) (yet), that have helped me reframe what it means
to work and work well. Paul Graham's [take on work](https://paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)
has been especially influential on me.

Strangely, work tends to get a bad rap in today's society. Ambition has become somewhat of a dirty
word. But I think a lot of this is because people conflate their job (or, if they are young, school)
with work. And if your job sucks, or you're learning things in school that you have zero interest in,
then naturally you're going to dread going to "work". You are going to resort to language such as
I _have_ to go to work tomorrow, rather than I _get_ to go to work tomorrow. The underlying
[metaphor](/posts/metaphors-and-the-infinite-game) is that WORK IS A NECESSARY EVIL. Something to put up with.
Something that society forces us into.

Through my reading and reflection, I've come to change that metaphor. For me, WORK IS A SPIRITUAL OPPORTUNITY.
