Welcome to the _Learning Machine Learning_ (LML) series! I've recently embarked on a journey
to learn machine learning. I'm working through Andrej Karpathy's [Zero to Hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)
lectures on YouTube, as well as the [Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning/paidmedia?utm_medium=sem&utm_source=gg&utm_campaign=b2c_namer_deep-learning_deeplearning-ai_ftcof_specializations_px_dr_bau_gg_sem_pr-bd_us-ca_en_m_hyb_17-08_x&campaignid=904733485&adgroupid=46370300620&device=c&keyword=deeplearning%20ai%20coursera&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&creativeid=415429098219&assetgroupid=&targetid=kwd-659621418624&extensionid=&placement=&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=904733485&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqqDFBhDhARIsAIHTlkvbwRNyldzz6eN7Gfy7W19CTacXCq_rvpKdtqXwR5jOU33NkJkZtdoaAqqfEALw_wcB)
course on Coursera by Andrew Ng. Rather than just read books or listen to lectures on the subject, I'm emphasizing
learning by building, hacking, and teaching. Learning by building is a great way to apply
what you've learned on a project of your own. I have several personal projects in mind that
I want to build along the way. Learning by hacking is another great way to learn something,
because in order to hack something in the [original sense of the word](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html),
you have to _really_ understand it. For some inspiration and ideas I'll be reading through the [embracethered](https://embracethered.com/blog/)
blog for security-related hacks of ML systems. Learning by teaching is the final way
I will be solidifying what I learn. I plan to post on this blog and create YouTube
content.

In today's post we'll be diving into the _neural network_ architecture. We'll see
what a neural network is, how to build one, and how to train one.

# Neural Networks

Machine Learning is a broad discipline that encompasses many different "learning" algorithms.
Neural networks are one example. There are many others, like support-vector machines,
logistic regression, and k-nearest neighbors.
