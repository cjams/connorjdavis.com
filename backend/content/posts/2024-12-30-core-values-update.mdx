title: Core Values Update
---

I posted earlier this year on my core values. After about 4 months, I’ve thought about them more and have some changes as 2024 comes to a close:

* Health – this includes physical, mental, spiritual health. Also healthy relationships with people, work and things.
* Authenticity – expressing myself and doing things that enable me to remain true to myself.
* Discipline – I’m committing to a regular writing schedule. At least one post a month, for now.
* Growth mindedness – I’m not a great writer, but I know that I will get better over time with consistent effort. Writing about a topic will also force me to understand it more deeply.
  + This one captures creativity as well, which is important for me. Especially in the context of stretching myself to learn something new in order to solve a problem.
* ~~Inner peace – expressing my ideas will help me make sense of the present milieu and fire hose of information that we are all inundated with in today’s culture.~~
  + It’s not that I don’t value inner peace, but I feel this is more of an output than an input. In other words, if I adhere to the other values in this list, then inner peace follows.
* Connection – my hope is that someone will find the ideas discussed in this blog helpful, and that they walk away having learned something that can make a positive impact on their life.

Thanks for reading,

Connor
