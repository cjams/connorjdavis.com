How many times have you read about data breaches online? It seems like every other day there is another
headline of some [company](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/tea-app-hacked-13000-photos-leaked-4chan-call-action-rcna221139)
or [govenment](https://www.csoonline.com/article/566509/the-opm-hack-explained-bad-security-practices-meet-chinas-captain-america.html)
leaking peoples' data due to their database getting hacked.

In most conventional app designs, the user's data is stored as-is in the backend database. If an attacker
can find a way to access the database on the backend server, they gain access to all that user data.

Client-side encryption (CSE) is one mitigation for this. With CSE, all user data is encrypted on _their own device_
before being sent to the backend server. The backend never has access to the user's encryption key, and only sees
the encrypted version of the user data. This means that even though the backend may have exploitable bugs that allow an
attacker to gain access to it, there is no value in doing so[^1]. This is because the user data lies encrypted in the database
and is therefore unintelligible to the attacker.

In this post I'm going to explain how to implement client-side encryption (CSE) for mobile applications, specifically those
written in React Native.

We'll start with a brief intro to encryption and React Native fundamentals. Next we'll undertand how data is
typically handled in a client-server architecture for everday apps and how CSE differs
from the traditional approach. Then I'll explain the key components of the CSE architecture,
including flows for key generation, encryption, and decryption.

Let's Go!

    At least it isn't valueable from the perspective of user data. The server may have other sensitive information like
    intellectual property, or may sit in a privileged part of the network and allow for lateral movement.
    The server itself could be used for bots or generating DDoS traffic.
