I started this site to become a better writer and thinker. When I want to learn something, I force myself to write about it. It makes me stick with things longer and mull them over. Writing forces me to focus my thoughts and actions. It’s an organizational tool for my otherwise scattered brain. Writing helps me [think clearly](https://fs.blog/writing-to-think/).

Writing also puts my ideas to the test. I have an ego-driven tendency to not share what is on my mind, both in person and in writing. This blog is one step towards growing out of that default. I want to give my ideas the opportunity to be criticized by others. Fair criticisms provide new data. New data brings everyone closer to the truth.

My goal for this site is to grow as a person, a thinker, and a writer. I do my best to provide high-signal information on the topics that interest me. I hope you find some of the ideas valuable.

### Tip Jar

I am a believer in creating value and giving value back to someone that has created value for me. This philosophy is called [value4value](https://value4value.info/). If you ever derive value from my work here, consider giving some value back.

If you want to, you can use the “tip jar” on the top right side of the page. Enter an amount (in US dollars) and click the button. This will bring up a [BTCPay](https://btcpayserver.org/) QR code that encodes one of my Bitcoin addresses. You can scan the QR with a lightning-enabled Bitcoin wallet and send me value through the Bitcoin lightning network.

You also don’t have to spend money to give value. Sharing my content with your network is one of the best ways to support it.

This site is also an Amazon Affiliate, so if you choose to purchase something that I recommend through Amazon, I will get a small commission.
